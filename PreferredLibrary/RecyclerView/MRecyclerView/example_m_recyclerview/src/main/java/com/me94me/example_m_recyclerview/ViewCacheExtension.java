 * When {@link Recycler#getViewForPosition(int)} is called, Recycler checks attached scrap and
 * first level cache to find a matching View. If it cannot find a suitable View, Recycler will
 * call the {@link #getViewForPositionAndType(Recycler, int, int)} before checking
 * {@link RecycledViewPool}.
 * <p>
 * Note that, Recycler never sends Views to this method to be cached. It is developers
 * responsibility to decide whether they want to keep their Views in this custom cache or let
 * the default recycling policy handle it.
